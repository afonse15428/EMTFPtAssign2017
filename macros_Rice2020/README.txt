In this directory are a set of plotting scripts used for the Run-3 BDT training
and validation. A short description of each:

draw_trees.py - A simple plotting script for new students.

validate_inputs.py - Plots correlations between variables that are input to the BDT.

eff_L1T.py - Makes a baseline set of efficiency plots using the variables that are input to the BDT.

bdt_plots.py - Makes a set of pT resolution and BDT efficiencies from the output of the BDT.
